                <p> Today's youth are looking for something new and exciting in their careers. On such field is media
                    and mass communication / Although, journalism has always been around but with a sudden spurt in the
                    number of new channels and newspaper, the demand for mass communication professionals has increased
                    manifold. A lot of students are a looking to pursue career in mass communication and acquire skill
                    sets that will help them make a name in this field. Apart from journalism, advertising, public
                    relations, modeling, acting, jockeying etc also fall under the same category and are gaining
                    popularity. The education scenario is also bright as many good institutes are offering full-time and
                    part- time courses in media, films and mass communication.The courses can be pursued both at degree
                    and diploma level. Mass communication clearly implies that it involves communicating to the masses
                    through different modes.</p>

        <p> According to the target audience and the message to be broadcast, the media is selected. The information
            that has to transferred could be news or entertainment or both. The digital revolution is transforming
            the whole communications industry, and journalism is at the forefront of those changes. Print,
            Television and radio are the most popular mediums through which one can communicate with the masses.
            Apart from these three, Web is a fast upcoming medium gaining popularity in recent years, though it
            mainly caters to the young and educated audience. With the technological advancement in the field of
            broadband, IPTV and DTH electronic media, new media will further grow and open platform for many media
            and mass communication jobs and opportunities for students. Journalism and media studies are in the
            midst of not only a technological evolution but also a revolution. Careers in journalism have never been
            so competitive, therefore where you study and train could make the crucial difference to whether you can
            break into the business. We at NIMS aim to prepare a skilled work force for this new and emerging
            professional sector. The business of NIMS is to broaden your horizon, to stimulate an inquiring mind to
            search and present the truth, and to give you the skills and tools to do all these.</p>
        <div class="endsection">
            <p> The Institute offers an excellent curriculum that combines both theory and practical exercise to
                prepare the graduates for various positions in the media industry. While there is a strong emphasis
                on the "craft" of journalism, the curriculum is designed to help students draw on and supplement
                their basic education so they are better equipped to handle intelligently the fundamental issues of
                the day. They will be exposed to the principles and ethics intrinsic to the profession, to enable
                them to hone their journalistic skills. I extend a warm welcome to all those students enrolling with
                NIMS and wish them a bright and prosperous future.</p>
